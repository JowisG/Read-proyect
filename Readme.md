    <h1 style="text-aling: center">About the project</h1>
    <p>
    The project is a web page developed with PHP and with a “SQL” data base. The objective is to learn how to develop basic PHP and load correctly the contents of the web (like images, videos, structure...).

    <h2>Where I am?</h2>
    <p>
    I am currently writing and structuring the design of the website, so there is no database, no dynamic loads or fancy things with PHP.

    <h2>Currently done</h2>

    > Please do not try to help. You can fork or use the content of the repository as you may see, but please if you want to help just do it with spelling mistakes or other simple stuff. I am watching a tutorial for PHP and if I ever get stuck, I will search “StackOverflow”.
