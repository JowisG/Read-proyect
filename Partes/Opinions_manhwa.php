    <h2>Manhwas</h2>
    <p>I read a lot more manhwas than mangas (about an 80% more), so I believe I know which stories are worth the time. Most of the manhwas you will find here are the ones I think are incredible and you should give it a shot.</p>

                        This is a cozy story about a girl who wants to have her own farm but ends up having the farm in the middle of the imperial palace. This story is adorable and relaxing, there isn’t really any drama (well there is one so far) , just a girl enjoying farming while the palace officials and other characters get attracted by her goodwill and kind aura. There is a lot to love in this story, more in the full opinion.

                        A story about a mage starting his own restaurant and the people who come to this restaurant. Pretty simple synopsis, but don’t let yourself get tricked, this is a gem, one of the best there is when it comes to presenting the past of characters and prepare the situation for a grander purpose. All characters have backstories or some kind of story that makes you understand them, the protagonist is the highlight of all of them his past is just heartbreaking, this is a must read, more in the opinion.

                    Our protagonist wakes up in his own story, he decides to survive with the knowledge he has, but soon he realizes that a co-author has changed the story. This is a unique take on the reincarnated in your own story, this time it introduces changes in the story our MC isn’t aware of, coming to the conclusion that a co-author must have change it and may or may not be the one who reincarnated him. It has a lot of turns of events were the mc has to adapt, more in the opinion.

                        One day our protagonist wakes up the body of a third-rate villain and gets kicked out of the scholar dormitory, now he needs to survive the events that may arise in the future. This one is an artwork, I started reding it because I just found it interesting but expecting nothing. But I was wrong, the story starts slow, but it just keeps getting better and better to the point some of the arcs it presents are sublime, the characters have a lot of work put in them and the writing is perfect, more in the opinion.

                        Chapters: 90+ <br>
                        The story starts with the regression of our protagonist who remembered having a past life now back when she was a child, she decides she doesn’t want to relive the same life. It may start like other stories  with all that of being “iskaied” and regressed in her 2º life to start a 3º one, but this one doesn’t center itself around that concept but is just there to explain why she acts the way she acts or knows future events. In this case, the beginning is a wholesome father-daughter Manhwa and its beings to get complicated later, more in the opinion.

                        Chapters: 127+ <br>
                        A story about a stepmother that died just before she set out to a new life, leaving behind her stepsons, who are almost her age, but in the way to her new life she is assassinated and comes back to when her husband died, now once again having to deal with the weight of the family at the age of 15. I can explain it just with words but this is beyond a masterpiece, the drama it presents is unique and the art complements this greatly,  the writing is top notch, the character have depth and I takes its time to develop the story, more in the opinion.
