            <h2>Manwha</h2>
            <intro>
                <p>For those who don’t know what a manhwa is it is simply the Korean version of a manga. It also differs in the media is presented in, instead of a comic is a long digital comic strip that you scroll in your phone.</p>
                <p>I believe all of them are in color, which is a treat compared to the black and white style manga opts, don’t get me wrong I firmly think that the aesthetics manga has is great.</p>

                <h3>Kinds of stories to expect</h3>
                <p>The manhwas have similar stories to mangas, but they usually feel different enough making them fresh and new. The stories you mostly are going to find are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Strong protagonist in a fantasy world were monsters or other kinds of threats push the world to an unbalanced state</li>
                    <li>Romance “isekai” or reverse time fantasy stories</li>
                    <li>Academy or school manhwas</li>
                </ul>
                <p>There are always other types of stories but after a lot of stories, I think those are the most prominent types of stories, right now. They are not the only type of stories you may find, like in manga, but there is clearly an abundance of these kinds of stories.</p>
