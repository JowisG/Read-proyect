        <h1>Opinions</h1>
        <p>Deciding what are you going to read with the incredible amount of stories there are is quite hard, so usually you end up with 2 options. You start skimming synopsis or reading the first chapters to see if you will like them; or/and see reviews or simple opinions of people to see if the story is any good. This becomes quite tedious, and I feel like it is not going anywhere, but I will try to make it less of a pain by making more accessible opinions that talk more about the story without spoiling, just trying to transmit what you need to expect of the story.</p>

            <h2>Manhwas</h2>
            <p>I read a lot more manhwas than mangas (about an 80% more), so I believe I know which stories are worth the time. Most of the manhwas you will find here are the ones I think are incredible and you should give it a shot.</p>

            <h2>Mangas</h2>
            <p>Like I said earlier, I do not read as much manga as manhwa, so take my recommendations more personal than anything else. I do not read the usual popular stories, I am more into reading stories which donâ€™t have an anime and are more average, but some of them are quite good.</p>
